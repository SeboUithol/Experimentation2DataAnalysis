    "# Analysing data with Python and MNE\n",
    "\n",
    "_Sebo Uithol, PhD, June 2023. Thanks to Jeshua Tromp and David Vogelsang for their help setting up this Jupyter Notebook._\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the practical session EEG data analysis using MNE! This practical session is part of the course Experimentation II at Leiden University. In this session we will study the EEG signals during an Eriksen Flankers Task. We will get acquainted with the basic preprocessing steps, the analysis of the data and the interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we will be analysing was recorded at Leiden University, with the same equipment that we have used during the data acquisition practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was acquired during an Eriksen flankers task. This is a conflict task that belongs to the same family of paradigms as the Stroop and Simon task. Participants are instructed to respond as fast as possible to the direction of the central stimulus in an array like this by pressing a response button with the corresponding index finger (in this case the right index finger) The experiment was a bit more complex than the standard Flankers task, but we will ignore this here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flanking stimuli around the target are irrelevant, but can prime the correct response (congruent), or the opposite response (incongruent). Immediately after stimulus presentation, the attentional spotlight (the area of stimulus information that is selected for further processing) has not yet been narrowed, so the dominant information derives from the flankers, which may point at the wrong response. As the spotlight is narrowed, the support for the correct response increases. In the ERP you are likely to see initial signs of motor preparation for the hand indicated by the flankers (LRP) and signs of error detection processes (ERN). In addition, the ERP will show large components such as the P300. Prior to the P300, there is a weak negative component that is sensitive to the presence of conflict in the decision processes (N200). We will see to what extent these waves can be identified and quantified."

    "### About MNE\n",
    "MNE (MEG & EEG) is a python toolbox. Both python and MNE are free, which makes it an analysis combination that is rapidly gaining ground. Installing and setting it up can be a bit more tricky, though, as there is a web of versions, libraries, dependencies, etc, that can change quickly."

    "### About this tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial takes you through the absolute basic steps of EEG data analysis using MNE. MNE has an excellent website (https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html) with all the commands explained, and also sample scripts showing how these commands can be put to use. I encourage you to look it up, and incorporate the commands you find there in the script below. At the bottom of this tutorial there is room to add your own commants."

    "### Importing\n",
    "Before we can start loading the data, we need to have the proper tools in place. Obviously we need to import MNE. Next we import matplotlib, for data visualisation, pandas for data analysis, and numpy for working with data structures. If you don't like typing the same words over and over again, you can import libraries as a shorter name, for instance 'pandas' as 'pd'. This saves time later on, but it is optional."

You may also remember that during the acquisition we have used two electrodes named 'drl' and 'cms' as a reference during recording, and that we placed two electrodes on the mastoids in addition. Since drl and cms were close to the active electrodes, they are not an ideal reference for analysing the data. The mastoids are further away from the active electrodes, and not near the brain, which will make them a superior reference. We will set the average of these two channels as explicit reference for all the other electrodes. Can you explain the procedure? Could we have placed cms and drl directly on the mastoids?\n"

    "### Filtering\n",
    "The EEG signal can be constructed as an assembly of sinus waves of different frequencies, phase, and strength (a Fourrier Analysis). Of some of these frequencies, the very low and very high ones, we can be sure that they do not correlate to brain activity. Low frequencies may be attributed to amplifier drift, or sweat. We use a so-called _high-pass_ filter to discard this frequencies High pass means that frequencies higher than a certain threshold can 'pass' the filters; lower frequencies are filtered out.\n",
    "Higher frequencies we filter out using a _low-pass filter_. There is some controversy around the source of high frequencies in the EEG signal. We are certain that line noise (50Hz in Europe) and muscle activation contribute to this frequency range, but there seems to be evidence that higher frequencies can also originate from the brain. So you have to choose the threshold frequency of your low-pass filter wisely, dependent on your research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the names of the two filters always cause confusion. The value of a low-pass filter is always higher than that of a high-pass filter. Check whether you can explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use a high pass setting of 0.1 Hz. This is relatively conservative filtering (everything slower than 10 second oscillations will be removed), but choose this setting because our independent component analysis will work better this way. We can of course choose to do another filtering step after the ICA. If you try you will see that your data will already look a bit better."

    "To understand an Independent Component Analysis (ICA), think of a number of musicians playing in a room, while being recorded by multiple microphones. Each microphone picks up the sound of all the musical instruments, but, importantly, at different strengths. An ICA is a mathematical procedure to re-construct the sound of each individual instrument based on the signals of each of the microphones (test yourself: what problem does an ICA have to solve?). The number of instruments that can thus be isolated is limited by the number of microphones.\n",
    "Back to EEG data preprocessing: The raw signal is composed of proper brain activation as well as artifacts such as eye-blinks and saccades. What we want to do is identify components that can be related to occular artifacts, and then subtract these components from the raw signal. What would be left is a signal that does not include the contribution of these noise components. Here the number of components that can be estimated is limited by the number of electrodes. Since this data was recorded using 64 channels, we have ample components at our disposal.\n"

If we want to do source localisation we will have to use the difference between the ERP peaks and troughs of the various electrodes. You can see that during the positive peak at around 200ms, the spread over the scalp is quite good, with the greenish tints (frontal electrodes) are more positive thah the blue/purpel electrodes (what does that mean?). 2) The ERP components are much larger than the noise before 0s.
